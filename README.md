# Tilda-helper üöÄ

**Tilda-helper** is an automation tool designed to streamline the sales process for lingerie patterns from a Tilda website. Traditionally, the Tilda platform has limitations, and Tilda-helper offers an automated way to send PDF files with patterns directly to customers, saving the owner the hassle of manual operations.

## üéØ Project Overview

The core idea behind Tilda-helper is to provide an automated method for distributing lingerie patterns. Since Tilda doesn't inherently support sending pattern files directly, users would have to create a separate page for each pattern. This isn't feasible, especially with a large inventory.

Here's how Tilda-helper operates:
- The project receives order details for patterns from the Tilda site via webhooks.
- It then serializes this data, conducts various validations, and stores the order with all pertinent details about the client, their order, and the products within the order.
- Following this, Tilda-helper sends all PDF files with patterns from the order to the client's specified email address.
- In parallel, the project notifies the site owner's Telegram group about the receipt and dispatch of the order. If there's an error at any stage, the group is promptly informed.

Previously, the owner had to manually execute this entire workflow, a tedious process he followed for nearly two years. This involved checking the order table multiple times a day, marking new orders, and manually dispatching patterns to each client. With Tilda-helper, this entire process is automated, saving time and effort.
